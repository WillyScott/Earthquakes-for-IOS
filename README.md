# Earthquakes-for-IOS
Converted to IOS from MacOS https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/Earthquakes/Introduction/Intro.html

Note that on older iMacs can't run Apples original code because CoreData isn't available (only on macOS 10.12 SDK or later)
Will be adding a update on how to convert from MacOS to IOS.
Code was already in Swift 3.
The only issue is the dates show up incorrectly because they are a integer and from base (1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z).

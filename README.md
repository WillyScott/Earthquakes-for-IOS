# Earthquakes-for-IOS
Converted to IOS from MacOS https://developer.apple.com/library/content/samplecode/Earthquakes/Introduction/Intro.html
Note that on older iMacs can't run Apples original code because CoreData isn't available.
Will be adding a update on how to convert from MacOS to IOS (macOS 10.12 SDK or later).
Code was already in Swift 3.
The only issue is the dates show up incorrectly because they are a integer and from base (1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z).
